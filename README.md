In the beginning, the navigation bar is implemented. There's a button on the navigation bar- Get users. On clicking on the 'Get users' button, an API call is made, which leads to fetching of data, in the form of grids, using the 'map' function. The data gets fetched page-wise.

Thus, the data gets displayed successfully.
